<h2>DIET란 무엇인가?</h2>
I'm so <a href="https://www.aci.health.nsw.gov.au/resources/nutrition/nutrition-food-in-hospitals/nutrition-standards-diets" target="_blank" title="what is a diet?">hungry</a> that i can eat everything in the fridge.
But <strong>i have to <u>endure</u> this</strong> to make my body slim.
<p><img src="diet.jpg" width="50%"></p>
<p>so i eat less than normal and workout almost everyday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:50px;">but sadly i am starving because
i didn't eat properly today.
i also wanted to eat an army soup but i didn't eat on purpose not to gain weight
cus i ate bread and jam yesterday night</p>
i hope i don't eat a lot and stay healthy everyday. good luck to myself!
